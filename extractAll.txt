ICE AGE THEMATIC The Ice Age thesis predicts an economic environment of very low inflation and near

bond markets, and in absolute terms. A selection of the right stocks can help protect

investors during an Ice Age. Due to the deleterious effect of deflation/disinflation on debt,

investors will also want to own companies with low leverage or (better yet) large cash 
balances.  The basket is a liquid selection of the 51 Pan-European high quality stocks 
which are liquid, profitable, growing and self-financing. Strong balance sheets are also 
important. Ultimately, the basket is made up of companies with an attractive combination 
of lower leverage coupled with lower share price volatility.
SG SEASONAL FACTOR The SG Seasonal Factor Commodity Index is a commodity index strategy developed by 
COMMODITY INDEX the Societe Generale Research Department. It is a dynamic directional index that seeks to

It delivers an exposure to 25 commodity markets, driven by changes in 72 different 
(Global Markets)
seasonal factors and managed within a liquid, rules-based index framework. Each of the 
factors has been identified and analysed using sophisticated analysis models. In addition, 
each factor represents a specific seasonal dynamic with a logical and robust explanation, 
its purpose, and how it can impact or influence the price of a particular commodity given 
according to the seasonality factor. The SFCI consists of 25 mono-indices, each covering 
one market. Each mono-index can take a long, flat or short position based on the signal 
from the indicators (bullish, neutral, bearish, etc.)

clause in respect of the

Supplementary N/A Séverin Cabannes retains the benefits of the supplementary pension allocation plan for senior managers that 
pension plan applied to him as an employee prior to his appointment as Chief Executive Officer. This supplementary plan 
was introduced in 1991. Conforming to the provisions of Article L137-11 of the French Social Security Code, 
it provides beneficiaries with an annual pension to be covered by SG, as described on p. 94. This allowance 
depends in particular on the seniority within Societe Generale and the proportion of fixed salaries exceeding 
“Tranche B” of the Agirc pension. 
Each year, potential rights are calculated according to seniority and projected salary at the age of retirement, 
st
based on recognised actuarial principles. At 31 December 2015, on the basis of the seniority acquired and the 
reference compensation of Mr. Cabannes at this date, potential pension rights, whether payment conditions 
are met or not, and taking into account a retirement age assumption of 63 years, represent an annual pension 
estimated at EUR 113,000 (i.e. 7.5 % of his reference compensation as defined by the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate 
Governance Code). In accordance with the procedure for related-party agreements, this commitment was 
th th
authorised by the Board of Directors on 12 May 2008 and approved by the General Meeting on 19 May 2009 
th
(7 resolution). Mr. Cabannes also retains the benefits of the supplementary defined contribution plan that 
applied to him as an employee prior to his appointment as Chief Executive Officer. This defined contribution 
plan, established within the framework of Article 83 of the French General Tax Code, was implemented in 1995. 
Membership is compulsory for all employees with at least one year’s seniority in the company and allows 
beneficiaries to acquire annual deferred life annuity rights of 0.1% of their remuneration, capped at two annual 
st
social security caps. This plan is financed 1.5% by the company and 0.5% by employees. At 31 December 
2015, Mr. Cabannes had acquired deferred life annuity rights of EUR 753 per annum.

fiscal year 2015 was introduced in 1991. Conforming to the provisions of Article L137-11 of the French Social Security Code, it 
provides beneficiaries with an annual pension to be covered by Societe Generale, as described on p. 94. This 
allowance depends in particular on the seniority within Societe Generale and the proportion of fixed salaries 
exceeding “Tranche B” of the Agirc pension.
Each year, potential rights are calculated according to seniority and projected salary at the age of retirement,

based on recognised actuarial principles. At 31 December 2015, on the basis of the seniority acquired and 
the reference compensation of Mr. Sanchez Incera at this date, potential pension rights, whether payment 
conditions are met or not, and taking into account a retirement age assumption of 63 years, represent an annual 
pension estimated at EUR 54,000 (i.e. 3.5 % of his reference compensation as defined by the AFEP-MEDEF 
Corporate Governance Code).
In accordance with the procedure for related-party agreements, this commitment was authorised by the Board 
th th th
of Directors on 12 January 2010 and approved by the General Meeting on 25 May 2010 (8 resolution).
Mr. Sanchez Incera also retains the benefits of the supplementary defined contribution plan
that applied to him as an employee prior to his appointment as Chief Executive Officer. This defined contribution 
plan, established within the framework of Article 83 of the French General Tax Code, was implemented in 1995. 
Membership is compulsory for all employees with at least one year’s seniority in the company and allows 
beneficiaries to acquire annual deferred life annuity rights of 0.1% of their remuneration, capped at two annual

social security caps. This plan is financed 1.5% by the company and 0.5% by employees. At 31 December 
2015, Mr. Sanchez Incera had acquired deferred life annuity rights of EUR 398 per annum.

unexpectedly. Furthermore, changes in applicable regulations, 
such as the adoption of a financial transaction tax, could also 
impact the volume of transactions that the Group executes for 
its clients, resulting in lower revenues from these activities. In 
addition, because the fees that the Group charges for managing 
its clients’portfolios are in many cases based on the value or 
performance of those portfolios, a market downturn that reduces 
the value of its clients’portfolios or increases the amount of 
withdrawals would reduce the revenues the Group generates from 
its asset management, custodial and private banking businesses.
23. The Group’s ability to retain and attract qualified employees 
is critical to the success of its business, and the failure to 
do so may materially adversely affect its performance.
Societe Generale’s employees are its most important resource, 
and industry competition for qualified personnel is intense. 
In order to attract, retain and engage talented employees, 
the Group must offer career paths, training and development 
opportunities and compensation levels in line with its competitors 
and market practices. If the Group were unable to continue to 
engage highly-qualified employees, its performance, including its 
competitive position and client satisfaction, could be materially 
adversely affected. Furthermore, the financial industry in Europe 
will continue to experience more stringent regulation of employee 
compensation, including rules related to bonuses and other 
incentive-based compensation, clawback requirements and 
deferred payments, and Societe Generale, like all participants 
in the financial industry, will need to adapt to this changing 
environment in order to attract and retain qualified employees.
Societe Generale has undertaken a review of the risks that could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position and results 
of operations, and does not consider there to be other material risks beyond those presented in the “Types of risks” from the Report of the   
Chairman (p.115) and “Risks factors” sections of this chapter.

For the other consolidated CSR Information, we assessed its

Finally, we assessed the relevance of the explanations in light of, 
where appropriate, the partial or total absence of certain information.
We consider that the sampling methods and sizes of the samples 
that we considered by exercising our professional judgement allow us 
to express a limited assurance conclusion; an assurance of a higher 
level would have required more extensive verification work. Due to the 
necessary use of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent 
in the functioning of any information and internal control system, the 
risk of non-detection of a significant anomaly in the CSR Information 
cannot be totally eliminated.

prevention of over-indebtedness, digital security and data protection), the group’s environmental and social commitments when conducting its business (sector policies, the 
Equator Principles, E&S evaluations of transactions and clients, green financing to companies), relationships with the stakeholders (customer satisfaction and the ombudsman), 
factoring social and environmental issues into the sourcing policy.
Environmental information: the general policy on environmental matters, greenhouse gas emissions (emissions of CO per occupant).

assets, which are averages weighted by the fair value of assets.
(2) The range of expected rates of return on plan assets rate is related to the composition of the assets.Generally, expected return rates of plan assets are calculated by weighting 
expected anticipated returns on each category of assets with their respective weights in the asset fair value.
(3) The yield curves used to discount the liabilities are corporate AA yield curves (source: Merrill Lynch) observed in the end of October for USD, GBP and EUR, and corrected at 
the end of December if the increase in discount rates had a significant impact. Inflation rates used are the long-term targets of the Central Banks of the monetary areas above.
(4) The average remaining working lifetime of employees is calculated taking into account turn over assumptions.
(5) The assumptions described above have been applied on post-employment benefit plans.
